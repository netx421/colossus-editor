# COLOSSUS Editor  
A minimalist, high-contrast, monochrome text editor built with GTK3 and GtkSourceView.

COLOSSUS Editor is designed to inherit the system GTK3 theme while providing a
clean, distraction-free CRT-inspired coding experience using a custom
high-contrast greyscale syntax scheme. It is fast, lightweight, and ideal for
writing scripts, configs, and source code.
